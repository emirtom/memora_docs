# Anomaly Detection with Memora
In today’s world, detecting anomalies—events that deviate from the norm—is crucial for various applications like fraud detection, monitoring system performance, and quality control in manufacturing. But what exactly is anomaly detection, and how can you build a system to do it effectively using Memora? Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with AI; this guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## What is Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify rare events or observations that differ significantly from the majority of the data. For instance, if you monitor transactions on a website, most activities are normal. However, if you spot an unusual transaction—like a user making a purchase far outside their typical spending behavior—that’s an anomaly.

In simple terms, anomaly detection helps identify patterns that don’t fit expected behavior. These can be signs of errors, fraud, or other significant events that need attention.

## Why Use Memora for Anomaly Detection?
Traditional databases are great for storing structured data but aren't built for the speed and efficiency needed for tasks like anomaly detection, especially when dealing with unstructured data (e.g., images, logs, or text). A vector database, on the other hand, is designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors, which are numerical representations of your data points.


Using a vector database allows you to quickly compute similarity scores between data points, making it easier to find anomalies by identifying data points that are dissimilar to the majority of the dataset.
