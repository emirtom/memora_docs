# Introduction
In today’s world of AI and machine learning, there’s a powerful tool called vector embeddings that’s driving the technology behind things like chatbots, image searches, and voice assistants. These embeddings are a way for computers to understand, compare, and work with data in a meaningful way. In this blog, we’ll break down what vector embeddings are, how they work, and why they are so important.


# What are Vector Embeddings
Think of a vector as a list of numbers. When we talk about vector embeddings, we’re talking about turning different kinds of information—like words, pictures, or sounds—into these lists of numbers. This is useful because these numbers help computers find patterns in the information.

The data that we want to use can have many attributes and features. These attributes and features can be represented by a different number in our list of numbers. AI models are used to extract the necessary information from our data.

# Types of Data in Vector Embeddings
Different kinds of information can be converted into vectors using special models and algorithms designed to recognize patterns in that data. Here’s how it works for three common types:

1. **Image Embeddings**
   When a computer looks at a photo, it can use models like Convolutional Neural Networks to pull out details such as edges, shapes, and colors, turning these details into numbers. This allows the computer to recognize objects in the photo or find similar images. For instance, if you upload a picture of a cat, image search tools can find other pictures of cats based on the numbers they’ve assigned to the image features.

2. **Audio Embeddings**
   Sound, like speech or music, can also be turned into vectors. Models analyze the sound waves and convert things like pitch and tempo into numbers. This helps in creating technology like voice assistants (e.g., Siri) or music recommendation systems, which use these numbers to understand and respond to audio in intelligent ways.

3. **Text Embeddings**
   When it comes to words and sentences, models like Word2Vec and BERT turn text into numbers. These models work by looking at words that often appear together. Each embedding can be represented in the vector space and the relations between the words often become visible to eye.

   As can you see in the picture, word "king" and "man" have a similar relation to the relation between "queen" and "woman". Other relations similar to that can also be seen. This helps computers understand the meaning and context behind the words, making it possible for applications like chatbots and translation services to function.
